<p align="center">A sample template to build software with Zig-PSP!</p>

## What's this?

This is a quick template that uses the Zig-PSP toolchain as a submodule in order to develop for the PSP using Zig. The include path is now "Zig-PSP/src/psp/" as the base directory for includes instead of "psp/"
